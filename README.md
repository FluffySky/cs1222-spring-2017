Welcome to CSULA CS1222 Introduction to Relational Databases.  Here are the topics that we will cover for this class.  

![overview](resources/images/plan.png)

This course is based on the Stanford University Database course, with some additional topics.  Note that the primary database system that we will use for this class is
`MySQL`.  Although you can use other DBMS, e.g. `PostgresSQL` or `SQL Server`, however your mileage will vary.

Please refer to the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md) for more information on the administrative guideline.

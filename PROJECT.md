# SQL project

* Due: 5/11 -- late project not accepted
* Up to two students may collaborate; please be prepared to discuss individual contributions

(note that this is work in progress we will flush out the details as the semester progresses)

Consider two canonical large databases:

- The [World Database](world.zip) (real data)
- The [Employee Database](https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db) (fictious data)

Your team may choose *one* of two databases for this project.  

### Warm Up

First thing to do is to load data into the database.
